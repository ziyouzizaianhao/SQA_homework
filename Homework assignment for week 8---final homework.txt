    Competition is in every place in modern society,product quality is the fundamental guarantee for an invincible position in the fierce competition in the market.Every company requires to meet customer demand as the source for enterprise development,continuously improving qualition of product and service,providing customers with the highest quality products and services.Only in this way,companies can enhance their own strength,win more and more customers in the market,winning in competition with rivals.IBM Rational SDP provides protection for software qualition.
    First of all, most fundamental reason for the software quality problem is that a software development team has no accurate understanding of customer needs.SDP provides a business modeling techniques to help development teams to better understand the customer's business processes and business needs.Use case modeling techniques to help more clearly describe the software system requirements.Thus ensuring the quality in the source needs.Secondly,SDP recommended to facilitate visual modeling based architecture and component for software reuse technology.The higher the degree of reuse, the less they need to develop workload, thereby improving software quality.Another SDP also provides a comprehensive automated software testing solution on the test session on product quality strictly.In short,Software should not rely solely on the quality of the test to get,SDP advocated the outset of the project for producing high quality software,it provides appropriate quality assurance program for every aspect of the software development life cycle.
    Time delivery system.Software system development process fraught with risk and change,thus software development has uncontrollable,delays offen ccur for software projects.So,software systems are often not on time delivery to customers,Or even delivered on time, but at the expense of the quality for the price.IBM Rational SDP advocated the concept of iterative development which is an effective way to control project risks,through iterative development project we can give priority to solving some of the problems of high-risk.In addition, SDP can help developers to build a flexible system architecture,so that the system not only meet current needs, but also to meet the future needs of the proposed change.Reusing existing framework is also another effective way to improve software development productivity,member of the SDP ideas and solutions for SOA is to help software teams through the use of existing software components to quickly complete the development of application systems.
    Reduce development costs.At the same time delivering high-quality software systems, we also need to control development costs of the project,in the same conditions of qualition, reduce development costs help to improve the software team profit margins, reducing corporate investment in IT projects can produce the greatest return on investment.
    First of all,IBM Rational SDP  improves software development team productivity,make each developer freed from some mechanical repetitive work, so that they engage in some of the more creative work,The repetitive work is completed by develop tools.On the other hand, the development of processes and methods  is a combination of the entire software industry best practices for decades, effectively reducing the development process and reducing rework error rate, so greatly avoiding wasted effort in the development process to help development teams save a lot of development costs and resources.
