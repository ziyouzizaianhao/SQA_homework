Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives.

Inspection vs. preventive actions

Inspection coupled with causal analysis
Together drive preventive actions
Key difference: error vs fault focus
Inspection vs. formal verification

FV (cid:25) formalized inspection
Focus: people vs. mathematical/logical
Tradeoff: formality vs. cost
Training and acceptability issues
Inspection vs. testing

Existence of the implemented product
Levels of quality/defects
Static vs. dynamic defects
Localized vs. interconnected defects
Combined approaches

phases and transitions
inspection of testing entities/processes
Inspection vs. fault tolerance

Complementary instead of competing

(e.g., inspect individual versions)

Static vs. dynamic

Inspection of FT techniques/mechanisms
