Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives

Testing vs defect prevention. Object: code vs implementation. Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs implementation. Expertise level: low-high vs medium-high. Observation: failures vs errors & error sources. Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs systematic errors or conceptual mistakes. Result interpretation: moderate vs intangible. Cost: medium(low-high) vs low.

Testing vs inspection. Bbject: code vs design,code and other software artifacts. Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs all. Expertise level: low-high vs low-medium. Observation: failures vs faults. Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs static & localized faults. Result interpretation: moderate vs easy. Cost: medium(low-high) vs low-medium.

Testing vs formal verification. Object: code vs design/code with formal specification. Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs design/coding. Expertise level: low-high vs high. Observation: failures vs (absence of) faults. Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs local faults. Result interpretation: moderate vs hard. Cost: medium(low-high) vs high.

Testing vs fault tolerance. Object: code vs operational software system. Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation. Expertise level: low-high vs high. Observation: failures vs local failures. Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs operational failures in small areas. Result interpretation: moderate vs hard. Cost: medium(low-high) vs high.

Testing vs failure containment. Object: code vs system with potential accidents. Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation. Expertise level: low-high vs high. Observation: failures vs accidents. Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs accidents and related hazards. Result interpretation: moderate vs hard. Cost: medium(low-high) vs highest
